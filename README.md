### Abu's Angular Advice
- Create your new app starting with nx.
- Use strict mode and a very strict linter config (don't forget to lint your styles too). 
- Learn a state management tool. 
- Write unit tests, and e2e tests. 
- "Script everything you have to do more than thrice."
- Services are for code that does things. HttpClient is only correct in a Service IMO.
- Never subscribe in your Service, always return the Observable.
- Components are to create new DOM and attach Service to it.
- Directives are to attach Services to existing DOM.
- Pipes are to do pure data transformations in your templates.
- Use Formly for any form more complicated than 3 fields, or just always.
